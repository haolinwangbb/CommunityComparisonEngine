# The Community Comparison Engine

This is a prototype of part of the comparison tool we have been working on for The Expedition Works.
This set of coding aims to input the structured form (containing "Age, Annual Income, Gender, Ethnicity, CrossStreet 1 & CrossStreet 2") and then find out the Community District of the particular row. 
We then use Community Districts as our location boundaries to compare our input data with the ground truth data. Several statistical models will be used for the comparison.
